# Day 2

## Summary

- DevOps engineer most likely won't be programming the application, but needs a good understanding of the architecture, how the systems tools and processes work as well as how required (data) services talk to each other
- DevOps engineer should figure out how the application can and should be tested
- DevOps engineer will deploy the application somewhere, be it on-premises, cloud or in a serverless environment
- Servers most likely run on Linux, but for example Windows has server editions with PowerShell
- DevOps engineer should pursue to answer the question "how do we get completed features and bug fixes into our production and make it available to end users?"
- DevOps engineer needs to ensure the deployable application isn't too resource intensive to run and doesn't have any immediate security flaws through thorough monitoring, or through load balancing
